# DHSVM-RBM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fortran source code for simulating stream temperatures with forcing from DHSVM. This code includes capability for including monthly variations in leaf extinction coefficients and module for simulating some features of thermal stratification in deep reservoirs. This code was used for the paper "Assessing the Impacts of Hydrologic and Land Use Alterations on Water Temperature in the Farmington River Basin in Connecticut" published in the journal, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences.
