# DHSVM-RBM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fortran source code for simulating stream temperatures with forcings from DHSVM. This code includes the capability for including monthly variations in leaf extinction coefficients and a module for simulating some features of thermal stratification in deep reservoirs. The code was used for the paper "Assessing the Impacts of Hydrologic and Land Use Alterations in the Farmington River Basin in Connecticut", published in the journal, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences.

## Contents
This repository contains the source code for DHSVM-RBM in the directory, /src, and the control files, Farmington.net, Farmington.Leopold and Farmington.Mohseni in the directory, /data. There is also an empty file, Farmington.forcing, which represents the file generated by executing DHSVM (see repository jyearsley/DHSVM).
The simulation of the three-hourly water temperatures in the Farmington River and its tributaries is implemented by:

- Run DHSVM and create the file Farmington.loading and copy the file to a working directory
- Run make in the folder, /src, and copy the executable to a working directory
- Copy */data/Farmington.Leopold and */data/Farmington.Mohseni 
  working directory
